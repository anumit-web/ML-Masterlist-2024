            "Bot: content='Diamonds are one of the most fascinating and sought-after gemstones in the world, renowned for their extraordinary physical qualities and symbolic significance. Here\\'s an overview of diamonds:\\n\\n**Formation:**\\nDiamonds are formed deep within the Earth\\'s mantle under extreme heat and pressure conditions. They are composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice structure, making them the hardest naturally occurring substance. The formation process typically takes billions of years, and diamonds are brought to the Earth\\'s surface through volcanic eruptions.\\n\\n**Physical Properties:**\\n- Hardness: Diamonds are renowned for their exceptional hardness, rated as a 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making them the hardest known natural material. This hardness results from the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms.\\n- Brilliance and Refraction: Diamonds have a high refractive index, which means they bend light in a way that creates their characteristic sparkle and brilliance. This property is described by \"total internal reflection\" and \"fire,\" which refers to the dispersion of white light into a spectrum of colors.\\n- Chemical Composition: Chemically, diamonds are composed of pure carbon (C). The carbon atoms are arranged in a tetrahedral structure, forming a strong and rigid lattice.\\n- Clarity: Natural diamonds often contain unique birthmarks or internal characteristics known as inclusions, while others may have external characteristics called blemishes. The fewer and smaller these characteristics, the higher the clarity grade of a diamond.\\n\\n**Types and Colors:**\\n- Diamonds occur in various colors, including colorless (or white), yellow, brown, blue, green, pink, and even rare red and purple hues. Colorless diamonds are the most popular for jewelry, while colored diamonds, known as \"fancies,\" are highly prized and valuable.\\n- Type Ia, Ib, and IIa are the most common types of diamonds, classified based on their nitrogen and boron impurities.\\n\\n**Cut and Shape:**\\n- Diamond cutting is an art that maximizes a diamond\\'s brilliance and fire. The most common diamond shape is the round brilliant cut, which has 58 facets. Other popular shapes include princess, emerald, oval, pear, and marquise.\\n\\n**Symbolism and Cultural Significance:**\\n- Diamonds have long been associated with love, commitment, and strength. They are a popular choice for engagement and wedding rings, symbolizing eternal love.\\n- The word \"diamond\" originates from the Greek word \"adamas,\" meaning unconquerable and indomitable, reflecting the stone\\'s hardness.\\n- Historically, diamonds have been symbols of power, wealth, and royalty. They have been coveted and worn by monarchs and aristocrats throughout history.\\n\\n**Industrial Uses:**\\nBeyond their use in jewelry, diamonds have important industrial applications due to their hardness and thermal conductivity. They are used in cutting, drilling, and polishing tools, as well as in electronics and high-performance bearings.\\n\\n**Source and Mining:**\\nDiamonds are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, as well as alluvial deposits. Major diamond-producing countries include Russia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, and Canada.\\n\\n**Grading and Certification:**\\nDiamonds are graded and certified by gemological institutes like the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) based on the 4Cs: Carat (weight), Cut, Color, and Clarity. This grading system helps standardize the quality assessment of diamonds.\\n\\n**Value and Market:**\\nDiamonds are valuable gemstones, and their price is determined by a combination of the 4Cs, current market trends, and the diamond\\'s overall beauty and rarity. Large, high-quality diamonds can command extremely high prices at auctions and in the retail market.\\n\\nDiamonds have captivated humans for centuries with their beauty, durability, and symbolism, making them a significant part of the jewelry industry and a fascinating subject in geology and gemology.' additional_kwargs={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': '023602f4-2d87-43fa-879f-3c45056061b2', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 210.0, 'output_tokens': 800.0}} response_metadata={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': '023602f4-2d87-43fa-879f-3c45056061b2', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 210.0, 'output_tokens': 800.0}} id='run-8c13e7f7-ab54-426d-952d-1afb8cb61af8-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 210, 'output_tokens': 800, 'total_tokens': 1010}\n",
